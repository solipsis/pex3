	 * Search bars (might have to use swing text boxes for this)
	 * basic search searches either name or words in description
	 * advanced search
	 * 		Options: actors, genre, rating
	 * 		use the generate result set I have in the home panel class	
	 * 
	 * once you have results add buttons for sorting
	 * 		alphabetical, by actor, genre, etc
	 * 
	 * when you hover over a result show a popup that has movie subscription
	 * 		steal the hover code form my MovieView class / actor class
	 * 		will need to implement MouseListener and MouseMotionListener and use mouse Moved function
	 * 
	 * create a class called clickable link or something that will be the results from the queries
	 * 		add Box stuff link I did in Actor so that you can use a Rectangle as bounding box for detecting if 
	 * 			mouse is hovering
